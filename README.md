# üß† Bianca Swidler ‚Äì Project Portfolio

Welcome! I‚Äôm a systems-minded strategist working at the intersection of AI, policy, and equity. This GitHub hosts a collection of tools, prototypes, and research archives‚Äîsome polished, others experimental‚Äîthat reflect my curiosity and commitment to building thoughtful, data-driven systems.

## üîç Featured Projects

### [`autoSort`](https://github.com/bsloanes/autoSort)
**Status:** Usable/demo ready
**Purpose:** Automates classification of USAF documents into Classified, CUI, and non-CUI categories.  
**Tech:** Python
**What I‚Äôd do differently:** Add modularity, confidence scoring, and UI for non-technical stakeholders.

### [`DiversityIndex`](https://github.com/bsloanes/DiversityIndex)
**Status:** Usable but not updated with current development capabilities
**Purpose:** Simulates Gini-Simpson Diversity Index to explore uncertainty in small-population sampling.  
**Tech:** Python, Jupyter  
**Reflection:** Next steps would involve Air Force demographic data integration (for internal reporting) and rounding out the Confidence Interval simulation here with proper CI bootstrapping CI envelope calculated with foundational statistical tools (or, alternatively, running null hypothesis tests with real and simulated data to test hiring bias).

### [`HBCUs_MSIs`](https://github.com/bsloanes/HBCUs_MSIs)
**Status:** Usable but not updated with current capabilities
**Purpose:** Identifies underfunding patterns at HBCUs/MSIs and proposes alternatives to PCA-based analysis for R1/R2 rankings.  
**Tech:** Excel, CSS/HTML/Java, CodePen  
**Outcome:** This work supported policy shifts in institutional ranking frameworks.  
**Reflection:** Creating a web version that is fully accessible to institutions for research and advocacy would be a game-changing next step.

### [`careerFields`](https://github.com/bsloanes/careerFields)
**Status:** Usable with some checks pending
**Purpose:** Scrapes and parses 150+ DoD career field descriptions to support AI role alignment.  
**Tech:** Python, NLP  
**What I‚Äôd do differently:** Use embeddings for unsupervised clustering by cognitive taxonomy.

### [`spaceVground`](https://github.com/bsloanes/spaceVground)
**Status:** Research archive, some errors still present in notebook runs.
**Purpose:** Undergraduate research on reconciling ground- and space-based Hubble constant observations.  
**Tech:** Jupyter, Python, statistical modeling  
**Legacy project:** Would love to revisit this with updated datasets and Bayesian modeling tools.

### [`adventofcode2023`](https://github.com/bsloanes/adventofcode2023)
**Status:** Usable/demo ready 
**Purpose:** Daily puzzle-solving for algorithmic joy and fluency.  
**Tech:** Python  
**Why it matters:** Reinforces logic fluency, speed, and‚Ä¶ a moderate amount (nay, a lot of) humility.
